Starbucks regularly sends offers to users of its mobile app. Not all users receive the same offer. The challenge is to determine which demographic groups respond best to which type of offer.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- `portfolio.json`: Contains offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
- `profile.json`: Demographic data for each customer.
- `transcript.json`: Records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
